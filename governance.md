# Self Governance

{:.sub_head}
Every community exists to solve a different problem, and they should be free to choose the best way to solve that problem.

{:.sub_head}
This playbook contains advice and things you can reuse, but ultimately the decisions are up to you and your community.



### Choosing a governing entity

There are a couple of likely options that your community may take to form it's governing entity:

- **One decision making body:** A single entity is responsible for governing the implementation choices for the entire community

- **Collaborating decision makers:** Several groups from the community are responsible

- **Community driven:** All the members of the community are responsible

Where a community largely exists to enable interaction with Government, it's likely that the governing entity will be an agency.

Where a community exists to enable a peer-to-peer exchange, the governing entity will likely be and industry body or self-elected group of representatives.

### Responsibilities of the governing entity

- Helping new participants join the community
- Deciding on the change management processes, and how the community operates
- Resolving disputes between members
- Representing their community in governance between communities

### Governance between communities

It is likely that your community will reuse and leverage work from others, and that's a good thing.

On behalf of all communities, we run a change and release process for anything that is shared by more than one community.
